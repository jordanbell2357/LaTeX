Is there any connection between the product (1-z^k) and cyclotomic polynomials?
Either the finite product from k=1 to n, or the infinite product from k=1 to
infinity. What kinds of connections might there be? Combinatorial (coefficients,
Newton's identities); algebraic number theory (cyclotomic fields);
analytic (asymptotic properties, Lp norms); something about divergent series.
