<p>Moreover, the comparative study of prices in Egypt and even in parts of Egypt (a nome, a toparchy, a village) is rendered very difficult by many peculiar circumstances. This is true, for example, of the prices of such a basic commodity as grain. In the statistical lists compiled by modern scholars the price of grain is shown per <span><em>artaba</em></span>, as if the <span><em>artaba</em></span> were a constant measure. In fact, as has been proved by Wilcken and Tarn, many <span><em>artabae</em></span> of various sizes were in use at the same time and in the same region of Egypt.</p>

The number of <span><em>artabae</em></span> paid as rent for each <span><em>aroura</em></span> and the quantity of grain paid in respect of the various taxes is often mentioned in the documents at our disposal.

<p>Latin and late Greek literatures are full of evidence in the form of comments, anecdotes, and quotations from earlier writers, as to the esteem in which the wine of Chios was held; it is the famous wine of antiquity. There was a not unnatural excitement, therefore, over some broken jars found last year in an ancient well when it was realized that they were stamped with the arms of Chios. One of these jars is illustrated on p. 202 (Fig. 1, 1). Of the five reconstructed, the shape and dimensions are so constant that evidently a uniform capacity was intended. This is approximately 22 litres, or six gallons. An anecdote of Plutarch informs us that in the time of Socrates an amphora of Chian wine sold in Athens for one mina, which is a hundred drachmas, or a hundred day’s wages to the skilled workman of that period. Our jars are dated by the deposit in which they were found in the third quarter of the fifth century B.C., probably about 430.</p>

I, 1; these are all similar in shape to a sixth, the stamp of which shows simply a kantharos; the seventh is no. 2 of this figure. For Chian clay, see the note on fabric (p. 201).

<blockquote>
<p>Similar complete Chian amphorae of a somewhat later time hold seven Athenian choes. Despite the evidence which makes the twelve-chous metretes the large liquid unit, the ordinary amphora of Greek as well as Roman times is more likely to hold eight choes.i This fact combines with the 7: 8 ratio of Chian and Athenian coins to persuade us that the Chian standard chous also stood in a 7: 8 ratio with the Athenian chous. These jars would then hold eight Chian, or seven Athenian, choes. On this pot the informal indication of capacity would then be the work of the Athenian purchaser, probably for a re-use of the jar.</p>
