     North-West  Corner  Entrance,  was  the  remarkable  stone  weight
     reproduced in Fig. 635.
     </p><!-- l. 22 --><p class='noindent'>It is 42 centimetres (16<img align='middle' alt='1

     in use in the last palatial Age, and is somewhat wedge-shaped above,
     with a perforation 5-6 centimetres in diameter. It could thus be
     suspended from a rope. Upon both of its sub-triangular faces is an
     octopus in relief, the tentacles in each case coiling over its square-cut
     sides.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 41 --><p class='noindent'>The fact that it scales exactly 29,000 grammes shows that we have
     here  to  do  with  a  ‘light  talent’  of  a  peculiarly  Egyptian  type.
     This answers to a somewhat low version of the Babylonian talent
     representing 60 <span class='cmti-10'>minas </span>of about 490 grammes. The Knossian weight
     would itself answer to a <span class='cmti-10'>mina </span>of 483<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>33 grammes.
     </p><!-- l. 47 --><p class='noindent'>It  further  appears  that  the  Palace  Standard  of  which  we  have
     here the evidence was approximately repeated in a series of copper
     ingots. Nineteen of these were discovered by Professor Halbherr and
     the Italian Mission in 1903, carefully walled up in four basement
     compartments of the small Palace of Hagia Triada, five of them
     presenting  incised  signs  (Fig. 636).  The  average  weight  of  these
     ingots–which themselves do not greatly vary in weight–is 29,131<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>6

     <!-- l. 60 --><p class='noindent'>It is clear, indeed, that this form of ingot, with its sides incurved to
     facilitate porterage, had a widespread currency in the Ancient World
     beyond the sphere of Minoan enterprise. The large hoard of these
     found at Serra Ilixi in Sardinia with inscribed signs had possibly a
     Cretan connexion, and those found in Cyprus still come within the
     Minoan range. But they are also seen borne as tribute by Syrians
     and Nubians. The material of one of the Hagia Triada specimens
     analysed by Professor Mosso was nearly 99 per cent. pure copper.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 73 --><p class='noindent'>Numerous examples of smaller weights were discovered belonging to
     the late palatial period. The typical shape was a disk, with sides
     in some cases slightly rounded off, and the materials were steatite,
     limestone, alabaster and, occasionally, lead. In many cases these were
     engraved with circular signs of numeration, and it has thus been

     possible to place together a consecutive series as shown in Fig. 638.
     </p><!-- l. 80 --><p class='noindent'>The  larger  of  these,  Fig. 638,  <span class='cmti-10'>a</span>,  of  black  steatite,  found  with  a
     late  Palatial  lamp  of  the  same  material,  N.E.  of  the  Palace,  is
     exceptionally marked with two larger circles, which, as the decimal
     system was in vogue, may in each case stand for ten of the units,
     represented here by four of the ordinary small circles [ ]. It would
     therefore be equivalent to 24 units. The weight, as corrected to its
     full original volume, scales 1,567<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>47 grammes. Its diameter is 11<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5
     cm. and height 6<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5.
     </p><!-- l. 88 --><p class='noindent'>Divided by 24, this gives a unit of almost exactly 65<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5 grammes
     (<span class='cmti-10'>c.</span> 1,008 grains). The unit thus arrived at represents 5 Egyptian
     gold units of <span class='cmti-10'>c.</span> 13 grammes (=65 grammes). This is 10 Egyptian <img align='middle' alt='12' class='frac' src='minoan1x.png' />
     units of 6<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5 grammes, the half being often used for calculation–the
     <span class='cmti-10'>drachm </span>as opposed to the <span class='cmti-10'>stater</span>.
     </p><!-- l. 94 --><p class='noindent'>Next in gradation is the weight <span class='cmti-10'>b</span>, of the same black steatite material,
     and also found in a late Palatial deposit. Five of the smaller circles
     are here engraved [ ], representing similar 5 half units of 6<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5 grammes.
     The diameter of this weight is 8<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>2 cm., and its height 2<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>9.
     </p><!-- l. 99 --><p class='noindent'>The next weight <span class='cmti-10'>c</span>, of white limestone, found with the preceding,
     presents 4 smaller engraved circles [ ], pointing to a unit of a little
     over 68 grammes. This answers to 5 Egyptian units of the somewhat
     full weight of 13<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>67 grammes. The diameter of this is 6<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>6 cm., and
     height 3<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>1.
     </p><!-- l. 104 --><p class='noindent'>Finally, the small flat weight of coarse alabaster found above the
     floor-level of the East Magazines has a single small ring on its upper
     surface showing that it represents a unit. Its original weight was 5<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>92
     grammes.
     </p><!-- l. 108 --><p class='noindent'>One flat disk of fine alabaster from the Palace site, marked with two
     small circles, scaling 8<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>54 grammes, belongs to a different system,
     and clearly answers to a light-weight Babylonian shekel, and a leaden
     weight of the same shape, of 8<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>45 grammes, must be classed with
     this. Otherwise, the correspondence of weights of this group, found
     in  a  late  palatial  association–as  evidenced  by  the  numbers  they
     bear and the original amount scaled by them–with the Egyptian
     gold units, may be regarded as conclusively established. This might
     in itself be expected from the close commercial relations in which
     Crete at this time stood to Egypt, so well illustrated in the tombs

     of  the  Viziers  of  Thothmes  III  and  his  immediate  successors  by
     the envoys of Keftiu and their offerings. A remarkable discovery,
     however, described below, now shows that the Egyptian gold unit
     was known in Crete by the very beginning of the Middle Minoan
     Age.
     </p><!-- l. 121 --><p class='noindent'>Amongst other forms of Minoan weights may be mentioned a bronze
     ox-head–found in a Late Minoan association of the votive stratum
     of  the  Diktaean  Cave–weighing  73<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>62  grammes  (1,136<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5  grains),
     Fig. 639, apparently representing 8 <span class='cmti-10'>kedets </span>of 9<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>2025 grammes. Like
     an Egyptian example of the same form from Tell-el-Amarna, it is
     filled with lead.
     </p><!-- l. 128 --><p class='noindent'>A  haematite  example  of  the  well-known  ‘sphendonoid’  class–like
     sling  bullets  slightly  cut  away  on  the  side  to  enable  them  to
     stand–was found on a floor of a basement room on the South front
     of the Palace. It lay beneath a wall of the Re-occupation Period
     (Fig. 640), and its affinities must be sought in examples in the same
     material from L. M. III tombs at Enkomi. It weighs 12<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>6 grammes
     (195<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>5 grains), and apparently represents a somewhat low Egyptian
     gold unit.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 140 --><p class='noindent'>The true Minoan mediums of currency seem rather to have been bars
     and rings of precious metal. The gold rings, of which a series was
     found at Mycenae, answer approximately to a mean weight of about
     8<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>7 grammes (135 grains), which looks like a slight reduction of the
     Egyptian <span class='cmti-10'>kedet </span>system. That gold bars were in use is demonstrated
     by  a  complete  example  found  in  a  Cypro-Minoan  tomb  at  Old
     Salamis, weighing 72<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>12 grammes (1,113 grains) corresponding to 8
     Egyptian <span class='cmti-10'>kedets </span>of 9<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>025 grammes (139<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>125 grains). A cut section,
     representing a fraction of such a bar of pale gold or electrum (two
     and a half <span class='cmti-10'>kedets</span>) was found at Mycenae (Fig. 653). Similar sections
     of the silver bars of Saxon treasure hoards were known as <span class='cmti-10'>skillings</span>.
     The Mycenae specimen is in fact a true ‘<span class='cmti-10'>skilling</span>’ or ‘shilling’.
     </p><!-- l. 155 --><p class='noindent'>That, however, the older standard in Crete was the Egyptian has
     received fresh and striking confirmation from a quite recent find

     made on or near the site of Knossos. This is a ‘weight-seal’ of solid
     gold and scaling 12<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>25 grammes (189 grains), which brings it within
     the normal limits of the Egyptian gold unit.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 173 --><p class='noindent'>This  is  perhaps  the  point  at  which  to  say  something  about  the
     Linear A script, for although it lies strictly outside the scope of this
     book, some references have to be made to it. Between the eighteenth
     and fifteenth centuries B.C. the Cretans employed an indigenous
     script, which they used both for keeping accounts and for dedicatory
     inscriptions. This was patently the source from which Linear B was
     borrowed; indeed it is likely that the Greeks began by borrowing
     Minoan scribes, who then adapted their script to represent the Greek
     language. Thus we can understand much of the content of the Linear
     A tablets; we know how the writing system works and we can assign
     approximate values to most of the syllabic signs. But although we
     know the meaning of a few words, it has so far proved impossible to
     demonstrate convincingly what the underlying language is. Further
     progress will depend largely on the discovery and publication of more
     texts.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 192 --><p class='noindent'>At what date Greek reached the islands is unclear; Thucydides (1.4)
     talks of Cretan supremacy in this area, and deduces archaeologically
     the  presence  of  Carians  (i.e.,  the  people  whom  he  knew  as  the
     inhabitants of south-western Anatolia) in the islands (1.8). Crete was
     occupied down to the fifteenth century by people who did not speak
     Greek, for we have their language in written form, and although we
     cannot securely identify it, there is no doubt that it was not Greek.
     This is the language of the clay tablets and other inscriptions in the
     Linear A script, which has been found in many parts of Crete, and
     in traces in the Aegean islands. The Cretans certainly established
     themselves outside Crete: the islands of Keos (Kéa, off Attica),

     Kythera (Kíthira, off Lakonia), Melos (Mílos), Rhodes and above
     all Thera (Santoríni).</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 210 --><p class='noindent'>The  archaeological  evidence  for  Minoan  colonies  in  the  Aegean
     islands all dates to an earlier age, and there is no reason to suppose
     that  by  the  end  of  the  fifteenth  century  any  of  them  were  still
     controlled by Knossos. The replacement of Minoan by Mycenaean
     imports, which is documented for several sites, of course proves only
     that Greece replaced Crete as the dominant power in the Aegean
     at this time, a fact also apparently witnessed by the contemporary
     Egyptian monuments.</p></blockquote>

     </p><blockquote class='quote'>
     <!-- l. 222 --><p class='noindent'>As explained in the Preface (p. xiv), the units of the metric systems,
     for which there were doubtless words, are represented in the script
     by special signs. In some cases we can guess what these words were,
     but since they are never written out syllabically we have no way of
     verifying these guesses. The way in which these signs are used differs
     from that found in the Minoan Linear A script, since there smaller
     amounts than whole units are described by a complicated system of
     fractional signs. In Linear B the signs (in some cases clearly the same
     signs) represent smaller units, which are of course specified fractions
     of the major unit. But despite the difference of usage, it would not
     be surprising to learn that the basic units were the same, and we
     shall see a remarkable point of agreement later on.
     </p><!-- l. 235 --><p class='noindent'>The weights are relatively simple, though we have too little evidence
     to complete the lower end of the scale. The largest weight, used
     of things like bronze, is a sign representing a balance, transcribed
     conventionally as <span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>l</span></span>. The largest unit of weight in use in the classical
     period was called <span class='cmti-10'>talanton </span>(Latin <span class='cmti-10'>talentum</span>, hence our <span class='cmti-10'>talent</span>), and
     since this name too means a balance, there can be little doubt that
     it was also the name of the Mycenaean unit. This is divided into 30

     <span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>m</span></span>, the classical talent into 60 <span class='cmti-10'>minae</span>; but since the Mycenaean sign
     is plainly double we can safely call this a double-mina (<span class='cmti-10'>dimnaion</span>,
     a word which remained in use as a monetary unit in Cyprus in
     classical times). The word <span class='cmti-10'>mna </span>(Latinized <span class='cmti-10'>mina</span>) is Semitic, and the
     sexagesimal system, based on 60 parts to a unit, is also clearly of
     Near Eastern origin.
     </p><!-- l. 248 --><p class='noindent'>The double-mina was then divided into quarters (<span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>n</span></span>), and this in
     turn probably into twelfths (<span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>p</span></span>); the doubt is due to the fact that we
     find <span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>p</span> </span>12 and <span class='cmcsc-10'><span class='small-caps'>p</span> </span>20, but these are perhaps not reduced to the higher
     unit (as we often quote a weight in pounds, and not as so many
     hundredweight, quarters, etc.). There is at least one smaller weight,
     used to give quantites of saffron, which cannot be certainly fitted to
     the system. The smaller weights are also used for gold. The smaller
     weights of the classical system do not appear to match: the <span class='cmti-10'>drachma</span>
     is one hundredth of the <span class='cmti-10'>mina</span>, the <span class='cmti-10'>obol </span>one sixth of the <span class='cmti-10'>drachma</span>.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 268 --><p class='noindent'>Evans found at Knossos a number of weights, the largest of which
     is a block of gypsum with octopus decoration. It has been disputed
     whether this is really a weight; if it is, its weight, quoted by Evans
     at 29 kg, must be a talent. The more certain examples are flattish
     cylinders, sometimes with markings on the top. A large one is marked
     with two large circles flanked on each side by two small ones, and
     Evans plausibly suggested that this was a notation for 24 units. This
     gave a unit of approximately 65.5 g, and other weights could then be
     shown to fit this: one with what is probably meant to be five circles
     weighs 327.02 g (65 <span class='cmsy-10'>× </span>5 = 327<span class='cmmi-10'>.</span>5), and another weighing 68 g is not

     in the Cyclades found, again in a Minoan context, a number of lead
     weights. These too appear to fit the Knossos unit: one with two dots
     weighs 121.3 g (if its original weight was 131 g this would represent
     two units), another with eight dots weighs 517 g (8 <span class='cmsy-10'>× </span>65<span class='cmmi-10'>.</span>5 = 524),

     of a number of competing systems current in the Minoan world,

     in the method of expressing weight shows, the units in the system

     <!-- l. 473 --><p class='noindent'>Although money, in the sense of coinage, had not yet been developed,
     the  system  of  barter  had  been  simplified  by  the  adoption  of
     certain fixed and generally recognized media of exchange–gold, silver,
     copper, and grain–in terms of which other trade goods could be
     priced  with  a  fair  degree  of  accuracy  and  consistency.  Values  in
     metal were usually expressed by weight, the units employed being
     the <span class='cmti-10'>deben</span>, a weight of about 91 grammes, its tenth part, the <span class='cmti-10'>kitĕ</span>
     (9<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>1 grammes), and a weight equal to <img align='middle' alt='1
12-' class='frac' src='minoan4x.png' /> <span class='cmti-10'>deben </span>(7<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>6 grammes) which
     modern scholars have agreed to call a ‘piece’. Since the last-named
     appears to have been ‘a flat, round, piece of metal…possibly with
     an inscription to indicate’ its ‘weight or the name of the issuing
     authority’, it ‘was practically a coin’. The ratio of 2 : 1 for the values
     of gold and silver seems to have remained fairly stable throughout
     the New Kingdom, dipping momentarily to 1<img align='middle' alt='23' class='frac' src='minoan5x.png' /> : 1 at the beginning
     of the reign of Amenophis II because of ‘the influx of large quantities
     of gold as booty and tribute from Palestine and Syria, then recently
     conquered’.  Copper,  with  only  <img align='middle' alt='1--
100' class='frac' src='minoan6x.png' />  the  value  of  silver,  is  always
     quoted by the <span class='cmti-10'>deben</span>, 2 <span class='cmti-10'>deben </span>of copper being generally equivalent
     in value to 1 <span class='cmti-10'>khar</span>-sack (2 bushels), of corn which itself was used as
     a form of currency. In the Eighteenth Dynasty 8 ‘pieces’ ( <img align='middle' alt='23' class='frac' src='minoan7x.png' /> <span class='cmti-10'>deben</span>)
     of silver or their equivalent in other commodities would buy a bull
     or a cow or the service of a female slave for four days; 6 ‘pieces’, a
     heifer or 3 arouras (2 acres) of (poor) land; and 3<img align='middle' alt='1
2' class='frac' src='minoan8x.png' /> ‘pieces’, a linen
     garment (<span class='cmti-10'>d3iw</span>) of good quality. Later in the New Kingdom the same
     garment was priced at 13<img align='middle' alt='34' class='frac' src='minoan9x.png' />–20 <span class='cmti-10'>deben </span>of copper, a tunic at 5 <span class='cmti-10'>deben </span>of
     copper, a calf at 30 <span class='cmti-10'>deben</span>, a prime bull at 130 <span class='cmti-10'>deben</span>, and so on.</p></blockquote>

     <!-- l. 512 --><p class='noindent'>No trade flourishes in ever so small a degree without a regular system

     average 8 grams ; its multiples are the mina of 60 shekels, and the
     talent of 60 minas (about 28<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>8 kilograms). This system spread to
     Crete. A magazine at Knossos contained a truncated pyramid of red
     limestone over the faces of which twined the tentacles of an octopus
     in relief. The weight of this object is 28<span class='tcrm-1000'>·</span>6 kilograms ; it is perhaps the
     standard of the royal talent, and the reliefs marked on it may, like the
     stamp on coins, be intended to prevent any fraudulent debasing. The
     subdivisions of this talent certainly belong to a sexagesimal system,
     that is to say, one which is both decimal and duodecimal. A marble
     cylinder discovered at Siteia weighs 1,140 grams, one twentyfth of a
